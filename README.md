# ReactJS-Discord-OAuth2
The ReactJS-Discord-OAuth2 project aims to provide tracking of useful information from a Discord server. Real-time statistics on sent messages, voice presence duration, as well as member verification upon server entry through Discord OAuth2. The project is not finished yet but will be updated in the future!
